# rowing-classifier
Deep Learning Model to classify rowing images. 

The model will be built on top of a pre-existing image classification model trained on the ImageNet dataset. More to come on that. 

## Road Map
This project aims to be able to classify an image containing a rowing boat into it's boat class (e/g single, eight, etc).\\ 
Firstly the aim is to be able to classify the images into two categories, eights (large boats) and smaller boats, before moving up to more categories.\\
 

The images are being provided by Ben Rodford, you can view his website [here]
(https://www.benrodfordphotography.co.uk/). He takes great quality photos of nearly every rowing event in the UK.
